 There is no way to learn something the easy way.
 You have to be patient. 
 That applies for developers too.
 Personally, that's why I like being a developer, because there will be always something new to learn. 
 If you stay curious, you will not be disappointed while becoming a developer. 
 Learning is always a challenge, a challenge to hone your skills, if challenge and skill at hand are in balance. 
 That's why it takes time to learn React as well.
